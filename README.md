# Important

Do ```npm install``` on both client and server before running anything

# Client

Use ```npm run dev``` to run the quasar client

# Server

Use ```npm start``` to start the node server

NOTE: The admin information is under the ```/database/user.json``` file. Do not modify admin credentials since that would no longer match with our client
